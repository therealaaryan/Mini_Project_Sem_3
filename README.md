# Mini_Project_Sem_3
This is my mini project assignment of my third semester.
There are few errors in this code as of now (eg: the compiler isn't recognizing .get() function :( )
The DBMS used is mySQL.

This is basically a GUI Program using Tkinter where a user can give input in a GUI and the information will be stored in mySQL database and those information can be retrieved/deleted.
