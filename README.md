# Mini_Project_Sem_3
This is my mini project assignment of my third semester.
The DBMS used is mySQL.

This is basically a GUI Program using Tkinter where a user can give input in a GUI and the information will be stored in mySQL database and those information can be retrieved/added/deleted.

The program has slight errors (AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'). Feel free to make corrections!
